## Ethos
The main goal of this project is to design an easy-to-use method of interfacing with widely-available [HUB75 RGB LED matrix panels](https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix/wiki/HUB75-Panels). All one will have to do is to snap the board onto place, program the MCU to oneâ€™s desire, and voila! The emphasis on the ease of use comes from the fact that it would result in user-friendly boards if I were to decide to make this a commercially available product. Nonetheless, all the files pertaining to this project will be open sourced! :)

## General Information 

### Programming and Software
This board is designed to be programmed in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). The board features a USB-C connector that is exclusively used to program the MCU (i.e. the matrix will not be powered on when only USB-C is connected). The ESP32 also supports over-the-air programming although this has not been tested with this specific setup yet.

### Power
The board features a 5V 5.5mm barrel-style jack that will be used to power both the MCU and the panel. Due to the high current draw of a HUB75 RGB matrix panel, an external DC power supply of 4 Amps (or more) is recommended. 

### Misc.
In addition to Wi-Fi, the ESP32 MCU features Bluetooth connectivity. The board will also feature 2 capacitive touch pads intended for use to control brightness (although ultimately they can be used for anything).
