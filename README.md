### Ethos
The main goal of this project is to design an easy-to-use method of interfacing with commonly available HUB75 RGB LED matrix panels. The emphasis on the ease of use comes from the fact that it would make such boards user-friendly if I were to decide to make this commercially available. Nonetheless, all the files pertaining to this project will be open sourced! :)
